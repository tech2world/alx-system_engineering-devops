# Web Infrastructure with Security, Encrypted Traffic, and Monitoring

This repository provides a whiteboard design for a simple web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com. The infrastructure includes measures for security, encrypted traffic, and monitoring to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Infrastructure Overview

The web infrastructure consists of the following components:

- 3 Servers: Three servers are used to distribute the workload, improve fault tolerance, and enhance performance.
  - Server 1: Web Server (Nginx) - Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and redirects HTTPS requests.
  - Server 2: Application Server - Executes server-side code, generates dynamic content, and communicates with the database.
  - Server 3: Database (MySQL) - Stores and manages website data.

- Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer evenly distributes incoming traffic among the web servers, improving scalability, availability, and performance.

- Firewalls: Three firewalls are added to enhance security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. Each server is protected by a firewall, ensuring only authorized traffic reaches the servers while blocking potential threats.

- SSL Certificate: An SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer to enable secure communication over HTTPS. This ensures encrypted traffic between the user's browser and the web servers, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or tampering.

- Monitoring: The infrastructure includes monitoring to ensure optimal performance, detect issues, and facilitate proactive maintenance.
  - Monitoring Clients: Monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic) are installed on each server to collect performance metrics and log data. They monitor server performance, resource utilization, application health, and network activity.
  - Data Collection: The monitoring clients collect various metrics and log data, which are sent to the monitoring service for analysis and visualization. This helps administrators gain insights into the infrastructure's performance and take appropriate actions.

## Explanations and Specifics

To address specific aspects of the infrastructure, let's explore the explanations:

1. What is a server?
   - A server is a computer system or software that provides services or resources to other computers (clients) over a network. In the context of this infrastructure, servers host and serve the website www.foobar.com.

2. What is the role of the domain name?
   - The domain name, in this case, "www.foobar.com," serves as the address for the website. It provides a user-friendly way to access the website instead of using the server's IP address directly.

3. What type of DNS record is "www" in www.foobar.com?
   - The "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, and it typically corresponds to an A or CNAME record in the DNS configuration. This record specifies the IP address or canonical name (CNAME) to which the "www" subdomain should resolve.

4. What is the role of the web server?
   - The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests from users' browsers and serves static files. It is responsible for processing user requests, generating responses, and delivering web content to the client devices.

5. What is the role of the application server?
   - The application server executes server-side code, processes business logic, and generates dynamic content. It interacts with the web server, retrieves data from the database, performs calculations, and formats the data for presentation.

6. What is the role of the database?
   - The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, including user information, content, and other relevant data. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve, update, or delete data as required by the website's functionality.

7. What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?
   - The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests the website, the server processes the HTTP request and sends an appropriate HTTP response back to the user's computer, delivering the website content.

8. Why are firewalls used?
   - Firewalls are used to enhance security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. They help prevent unauthorized access, filter out malicious traffic, and enforce security policies to protect the servers and data from potential threats.

9. Why is traffic served over HTTPS?
   - Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the user's browser and the web servers. HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server, protecting it from interception or tampering by unauthorized parties.

10. What is monitoring used for?
    - Monitoring is used to observe and track the performance, availability, and health of the web infrastructure. It helps identify issues, optimize resource utilization, detect anomalies, and facilitate proactive maintenance to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

11. How does the monitoring tool collect data?
    - The monitoring tool, such as Sumologic or similar services, collects data by installing monitoring clients on each server. These clients collect various metrics, logs, and performance data from the servers and send them to the monitoring service for analysis and visualization.

12. What to do if you want to monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second)?
    - To monitor the web server's QPS, the monitoring tool can collect and analyze the server's access logs. These logs contain information about the requests received by the web server, including timestamps and request details. By parsing and aggregating this data, the monitoring tool can calculate the QPS and provide insights into the server's request load.

## Issues and Considerations

1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
   - The infrastructure may still have a single point of failure if all components (web server, application server, and database) are running on a single server. Consider implementing redundancy, fault tolerance, and load balancing techniques to minimize the risk of service disruption.

2. Security Issues (No Firewall, No HTTPS):
   - Without firewalls and HTTPS, the infrastructure is vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches, and interception of sensitive information. Implementing firewalls and enabling HTTPS are crucial security measures to protect the infrastructure and ensure secure communication.

3. Lack of Monitoring:
   - Without proper monitoring, it becomes challenging to detect performance issues, resource bottlenecks, security incidents, or system failures. Implementing comprehensive monitoring is essential to ensure proactive maintenance, identify and address issues promptly, and optimize the infrastructure's performance and availability.

## Getting Started

To deploy and configure the web infrastructure, follow the steps below:

1. Provision and set up the servers:
   - Provision three servers, one for each component (web server, application server, and database server).
   - Install the necessary software and dependencies on each server.

2. Configure the load balancer:
   - Set up the load balancer (e.g., HAproxy) and configure it to distribute incoming traffic among the web servers.
   - Configure SSL termination and install the SSL certificate for serving traffic over HTTPS.

3. Set up firewalls:
   - Configure firewalls on each server to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security requirements.

4. Install monitoring clients:
   - Install monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic) on each server to collect performance metrics and log data.
   - Configure the monitoring clients to send data to the monitoring service.

5. Additional considerations:
   - Implement proper network security measures, such as access controls, firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems.
   - Regularly update and patch the servers

 and software to address security vulnerabilities.
   - Consider scalability and performance requirements, and adjust the infrastructure accordingly.
